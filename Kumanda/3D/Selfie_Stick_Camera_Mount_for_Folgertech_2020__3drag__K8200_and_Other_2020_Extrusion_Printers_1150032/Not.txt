Summary
I found a broken selfie stick laying around the house. The only think not broken was the camera holder. So I made a mount for my home built 2020 printer. I run the Android IP Camera app and I can watch my printer from anywhere on the network.

You will need these additional parts:

1/4-20 x 3/4" hex head bolt (standard tripod threads)
M4 x 30mm SHCS
M4 nut
2 small screws (I used a couple from an old 30mm fan that was laying around)
8mm tubing x 165mm (6.5")
Tripod camera/phone mount. There are lots of them on Thingiverse
